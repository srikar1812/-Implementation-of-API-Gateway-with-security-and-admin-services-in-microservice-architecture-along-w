Given the topic, our project had three domains at broad, front end development so that the user can interact with it, backend development for the business logic and Elastic stack for monitoring our application.  For the front end, we made use of software tools as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We made webpages for login, signup and admin.


• HTML: HTML stands for” Hyper Text Mark-up Language”. It is the standard mark-up language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as CSS and scripting languages such as JavaScript.



• CSS: CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets “. Cascading Style Sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes and other aspects of web pages. The basic purpose of CSS is to separate the content of a web document from its presentation. It allows the same HTML document to be presented in more than one varying style.



• JavaScript: Java Script by definition, is a Scripting Language of the World Wide Web. The   main usage of the JavaScript is to add various web functionalities, web form validations, browser detections, creation of cookies and so on. Java Script Is one of the most popular scripting languages and that is why it is supported by almost all web browsers available today like Firefox, Opera, Google chrome etc.
